# Fine-Tuning Large Language Model for Finance and Banking

This project focuses on fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM) specifically for the finance and banking sectors. The model has been enhanced using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Quantized LoRA (QLoRA), to improve its ability to handle domain-specific tasks and queries.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project was to optimize an LLM to provide accurate and relevant responses within the financial domain. By integrating custom datasets and leveraging advanced fine-tuning techniques, we achieved significant improvements in model performance, making it suitable for deployment in banking applications.

### Project Duration

- **Duration:** 2 months (June - August 2024)

## Key Features

- **PEFT Techniques:** Utilized LoRA and QLoRA to efficiently fine-tune the LLM for finance and banking applications.
- **Custom Datasets:** Engineered and integrated financial datasets to improve the model's understanding of domain-specific terminology and tasks.
- **Optimized Pipelines:** Developed advanced training pipelines using tools such as BitsAndBytes for quantization and SFTTrainer for structured fine-tuning.
- **Improved Accuracy:** Achieved significant improvements in the accuracy of model-generated responses for financial queries.
- **Skills Acquired:** Gained expertise in Python, generative AI (GenAI), and advanced model fine-tuning techniques.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Frameworks and Libraries:** HuggingFace Transformers, BitsAndBytes, SFTTrainer, PEFT Library
- **Platform:** Google Colab
- **Dataset:** Custom financial datasets sourced from various banking resources

## Results

After fine-tuning, the model demonstrated a significant increase in accuracy and relevance when handling financial queries, making it an effective tool for AI-driven banking solutions.
